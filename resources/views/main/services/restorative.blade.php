                                to traditional amalgam fillings. We use composite fillings to
                                repair decayed or broken teeth as well as to enhance the
                                appearance of any tooth. Composites bond strongly with tooth
                                structures, preventing future decay.

                                meaning it requires a mold to fabricated them. They also treat

                                aesthetic since they won't discolor. In addition, they can

                                Bridgeworks are used to replace missing teeth. They are able to
                                help balance a normal bite, preventing unnatural stress on the
                                dental ridge, supra eruption, and prevent drifting and tilting
                                of adjacent teeth. They will also prevent formation of decay in
                                abnormal areas and help delay the onset of periodontal disease.
                                These require 2-3 visits due to laboratory fabrication and will
                                be cemented permanently. They are comfortable, durable, and

                                Implants are intended for patients who have lost one or
                                more of their natural teeth. The implant will be surgically
                                placed in the jaw bone and can be restored through attaching
                                an artificial tooth crown to the implant. After it is surgically
                                placed into the jaw bone, a 3-6 month wait is necessary to
                                allow the bone tissue to grow around the implant.

                                Dentures are intended to replace missing teeth to avoid
                                shifting. Shifting can cause the mouth to sink in and the
                                face to change appearance. The lips may thin and straighten,
                                the chin may jut out and upward, and pouches may appear on
                                the sides of the jaw. Dentures are artificial teeth/pontics
                                attached to a base and it precisely fits the mouth. It
                                consists of several appointments, however. It is also
                                removable and convenient for the patient to clean.
